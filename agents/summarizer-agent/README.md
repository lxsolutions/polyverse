# Summarizer Agent

The SummarizerAgent provides thread-level TL;DR summaries using the AI mesh.

## Functionality

- Processes text content from threads/posts
- Generates multilingual summaries
- Integrates with the AI router for model selection and execution

## API Endpoints

- `POST /summarize`: Accepts text input and returns a summary

## Configuration

The agent can be configured to use different summarization models based on:
- Cost constraints (cheap/balanced/accurate)
- Latency requirements
- Content type (technical vs conversational)

## Safety Notes

- Summaries should preserve the original meaning without bias
- Sensitive content should be handled with appropriate filters
- Model outputs should be reviewed for hallucinations
