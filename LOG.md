## Actions Performed
1. Cloned polyverse and created branch chore/fold-polyverse-cluster
2. Added and fetched all remote repositories (opengrid, aegisgov, truthfoundry)
3. Used git subtree add to preserve full history for all services
4. Updated README.md with services map including folded services
5. Pushed branch and ready to create PR

## Notes
- All git history preserved using git subtree add (no --squash)
- Services added to existing polyverse monorepo structure
- README updated to reflect new service additions
- Polyverse already has comprehensive monorepo structure with existing services
- New services complement existing decentralized social + AI + payments platform
