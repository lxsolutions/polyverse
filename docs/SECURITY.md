## Security Principles

### User Sovereignty

PolyVerse prioritizes user control over their data and identity:
- **Portable DIDs**: Users own their decentralized identifiers
- **Content Ownership**: Users retain rights to their posts and media
- **Algorithm Choice**: Users select ranking/moderation bundles

### Defense in Depth

Multiple security layers protect the platform:
1. **Client-side**: User filters, local encryption
2. **Network-level**: TLS for all communications
3. **Application-layer**: Signature verification, rate limiting
4. **Infrastructure**: Secure containerization and monitoring

### Transparency

Security practices are openly documented:
- **Audit Trails**: All moderation actions logged publicly
- **Explainable AI**: Model decisions can be inspected
- **Open Source**: Core components available for review

## Key Management

### Passkeys and WebAuthn Support

PolyVerse implements modern authentication standards:
- **Passkey Storage**: Secure key storage using platform authenticators
- **WebAuthn Integration**: Browser-based biometric/authenticator support
- **FIDO2 Compliance**: Standardized cryptographic operations

### Hardware Wallet Integration

For advanced users, hardware wallets provide:
- **Cold Storage**: Offline private key management
- **Transaction Signing**: Secure approval of sensitive actions
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Additional security layer

### Social Recovery Mechanism

Users can recover access through:
1. **Guardian Selection**: Trusted contacts designated during setup
2. **Sharded Recovery**: Multiple guardians hold partial keys
3. **Quorum-Based Approval**: Majority vote required for recovery

## End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)

### MLS Protocol for DMs

PolyVerse uses the Messaging Layer Security protocol:
- **Group Chat Support**: Secure multi-party conversations
- **Forward Secrecy**: Session keys change regularly
- **Interoperability**: Standardized with other MLS implementations

### Forward Secret Sessions

Key security features include:
- **Ephemeral Keys**: Short-lived session keys
- **No Future Decryption**: Compromised keys don't expose past messages
- **Ratchet Algorithms**: Continuous key evolution during conversations

### Safety Scanning on Device

For user protection, PolyVerse implements:
- **Local Malware Detection**: Client-side scanning before transmission
- **Phishing Protection**: URL and content analysis
- **Explicit Content Warnings**: User-configurable NSFW filters

## Threat Model and Mitigations

### Sybil Attacks/Brigading

Mitigation strategies include:
- **Proof-of-Personhood Plugins**: Optional identity verification
- **Stake-to-Speak**: Temporary staking for high-reach actions
- **Reputation Graphs**: Tracking positive/negative contributions
- **Rate Limits**: Preventing spam and abuse patterns

### Illegal Content Distribution

PolyVerse employs multiple safeguards:
1. **Per-Relay Legal Modules**: Jurisdiction-specific compliance filters
2. **Client Default Filters**: Built-in safety measures for new users
3. **Swift Appeal/Resolution**: Efficient moderation dispute process
4. **Operator Liability Protection**: Clear terms of service

### Economic Attacks on Relays

Defenses against financial attacks:
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Adjust fees based on demand
- **Circuit Breakers**: Throttle abusive traffic patterns
- **Federation Allowlists**: Trusted relay networks
- **Reputation-Based Routing**: Prefer reliable operators

## Compliance and Privacy

### Per-Relay Legal Modules

Relay operators can implement:
- **Jurisdictional Filters**: Local law compliance
- **Community Norms**: Custom moderation policies
- **Transparency Reports**: Public disclosure of enforcement actions

### Geo-Fencing

Content restrictions based on location:
- **Regional Blackouts**: Prevent access to illegal content
- **Localization Compliance**: Adapt to regional regulations
- **User Overrides**: Allow users to opt into stricter filters

### Age Gates with Verifiable Credentials

Age verification implements:
- **Minimal Disclosure**: Zero-knowledge proofs for age validation
- **ZK-SNARKs**: Cryptographic proof without revealing actual birthdate
- **Revocable Credentials**: Expire and renew credentials securely

This security architecture ensures that PolyVerse remains a safe, private, and resilient platform while maintaining user sovereignty and decentralized control.
