## Payment Options

### Lightning Network for Micro-tips

PolyVerse leverages the Lightning Network to enable instant, low-cost microtransactions:

- **Use Case**: Tips for creators, small payments for premium content
- **Implementation**: Integration with LND or c-lightning nodes
- **Flow**:
  1. User requests tip invoice via client
  2. Relay generates Lightning invoice
  3. Recipient claims payment through their wallet

### Stablecoin Subscriptions (L2)

For larger, recurring payments:

- **Use Case**: Monthly subscriptions to premium feeds or services
- **Implementation**: Layer 2 solutions with stablecoins (e.g., USDC on Optimistic Ethereum)
- **Flow**:
  1. User selects subscription plan in client
  2. Payment processed via L2 transaction
  3. Subscription status tracked on-chain

### Custodial Ramps via Partners

For users without cryptocurrency holdings:

- **Use Case**: Fiat-to-crypto conversion for new users
- **Implementation**: Integration with partner custodial services
- **Flow**:
  1. User initiates fiat deposit through partner interface
  2. Funds converted to appropriate crypto assets
  3. Credited to user's non-custodial wallet

## Wallet Architecture

### Non-Custodial Wallet Integration

PolyVerse embeds a non-custodial wallet for users:

- **Key Management**: Secure storage of private keys using passkeys/WebAuthn
- **Transaction Signing**: Local signing of all outbound transactions
- **Integration Points**:
  - Event signature verification
  - Payment authorization
  - Storage pinning requests

### Social Recovery Mechanism

Users can recover access to their wallets via:

1. **Guardian Selection**: Users designate trusted contacts during setup
2. **Recovery Process**: Multiple guardians approve recovery request
3. **Key Rotation**: New keys generated and distributed securely

## Fee Structures
