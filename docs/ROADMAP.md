## Milestone Overview

### M0 – Research Spike (2–3 weeks)

**Objective**: Validate core concepts and build proof-of-concept bridges.

**Deliverables:**
1. Base schemas for PVP events
2. Bridge PoCs for ActivityPub, AT Protocol, Nostr
3. Initial protocol specifications

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Events can be posted, fetched, and verified
- APub bridge successfully echoes test posts
- Documentation of event schema and signature rules

### M1 – MVP Social (6–8 weeks)

**Objective**: Implement core social functionality with decentralized identity.

**Deliverables:**
1. Keys and profile management system
2. Post creation and feed consumption
3. Basic algorithm bundle selection
4. Web client interface

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- 1k Daily Active Users across 3 relays
- Successful key generation and profile setup
- Functional post creation, following, and feed viewing
- Algorithm bundle switching with visible effects

### M2 – Moderation v1 (4–6 weeks)

**Objective**: Establish the three-layer moderation system.

**Deliverables:**
1. Labeler API specification and registry
2. Client-side filter implementation
3. Appeals logging mechanism

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- 95% reproducible label decisions across test cases
- Functional keyword-based client filters
- Successful submission and retrieval of labels via API

### M3 – AI Mesh v1 (6 weeks)

**Objective**: Deploy the AI routing infrastructure with initial microagents.

**Deliverables:**
1. AI router implementation
2. SummarizerAgent for thread summaries
3. OnboardingAgent for user guidance

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- <600ms P50 routing overhead for chat requests
- Functional TL;DR generation for threads
- Successful onboarding flow completion (key creation to bundle selection)

### M4 – Payments v1 (6 weeks)

**Objective**: Implement the payments layer with Lightning integration.

**Deliverables:**
1. Wallet implementation with social recovery
2. Tips functionality via Lightning test mode
3. Relay/AI fee collection system

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- 10k successful microtransactions processed
- Functional wallet creation and recovery flow
- Integration with Lightning network (testnet)

### M5 – Mobile Beta (8 weeks)

**Objective**: Expand to mobile platforms with background key custody.

**Deliverables:**
1. React Native application
2. Push notification integration
3. Background key management options

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- 1k Monthly Active Users on mobile platform
- Successful push notifications delivery
- Secure background key storage implementation

### M6 – Governance & Marketplace (Ongoing)

**Objective**: Establish decentralized governance and feed/mod bundles marketplace.

**Deliverables:**
1. Feed/moderation bundles gallery
2. DAO voting infrastructure
3. Operator dashboards for analytics

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Successful community votes on protocol changes
- Active marketplace with multiple bundle providers
- Positive user feedback on governance participation

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. **Feed Reproducibility Rate**: Percentage of feeds that produce identical results given same inputs
2. **User-Selected Bundle Diversity**: Number of unique algorithm bundles actively used by users
3. **Relay Decentralization Index** (Gini coefficient): Measures distribution of traffic across relays
4. **Time-to-Appeal**: Average time from label submission to appeal resolution
5. **AI Mesh Utilization**: Percentage of AI routing capacity used vs available
6. **Creator Earnings**: Total revenue generated by creators through tips and subscriptions

This roadmap provides a structured approach to PolyVerse development, ensuring incremental delivery of core features while maintaining focus on decentralization, user sovereignty, and economic sustainability.
